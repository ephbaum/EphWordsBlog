description: The movies I've watched for Spoopy Movie Movie (FKA Halloween Movie Month) 2023
---

As I love horror movies & Halloween: every October (aka Halloween Month) I "watch" a slew of horror movies.

![DALL-E Generated Spoopy Halloween Movie Image](@/assets/images/2023/10/spoopy-movie-dall-e-c.webp)

Autumn is my favorite season and my favorite time of year. Halloween is my favorite holiday. Halloween month is my favorite month. You get it, yeah?

Watching a bunch of spoopy movies this time of year has been a tradition for most of my life. Recording these lists on spreadsheets started many years ago with a good friend who has since passed out of my life, but I continue the practice. I now have many years of spreadsheets collecting all the horror movies I watched each year. One year was just 100% Netflix and another year I watched almost exclusively _old_ horror movies. This year hasn't had a theme, I've just sort of watched things.

I don't actually _watch_ all of them, in a lot of cases these are movies that I've already seen and I just turn them on, glancing at them occasionally and listening to them. It's comforting.

This year I've run a lot of movies in a quest for some feeling normalcy.

## A Few Notes:

### Score Relativity

How do these scores relate to each other? How are movies like The Curse of Crom, Night of the Living Dead, and Trick r' Treat all rated 8/10? Because these scores are all arbitrary based on how much I like the the movie and not based on some complex scoring system. I, more or less, just rate them based on how much I like them or what they are. Animated and family movies are, of course, not really comparable to Terrifier, for instance.

### Scream Franchise in Reverse?

You may notice that I've watched the Scream movies in reverse.

You may wonder: why the hell would you do that?

That's a fantastic question and the answer is simply that I watched the most recent movie before deciding that I would watch the entire franchise again so I figured: why not do it in reverse?

It's actually been really interesting to experience them in reverse order, it hearing the call backs and then seeing them later has been kind of fun in a way I didn't expect.

Scream remains my favorite horror franchise.

### Original Friday the 13th

I made an effort to get through the original Paramount run of Friday the 13th Movies on Friday the 13 since it was the first Friday the 13th in October since 2006. I only managed to run through 5 and didn't really _watch_ much of those as it was a rather busy Friday for me.

Since then I have "watched" 6 through 8 and they are just so terrible. üòÇ

Still a super fun franchise, though.

The first 2 remain the best.

Like Scream (and a variety of other franchises)

### X & Pearl (and Infinity Pool)

I really enjoyed X and Pearl. Ti West is an excellent horror auteur. Inn Keepers remains pretty high on my list of favorite horrors.

I also watched Infinity Pool, which had more of a David Lynch vibe than I was expecting, but has officially given me my fill of Mia Goth. I don't need to see Mia Goth in any more movies for a while.

### Terrifier and Terrifier 2

They're terrible. The awful. I regret re-watching the first and the second was just dumb. Don't even bother.

I would watch the original short, though, because I've not seen it and figure I might as well.

### The Insidious Franchise

These movies have grown on me a bit over the years. While I firmly think the first two are the best (and that they're not _great_ though), the other movies are still a fair bit of fun and I found myself enjoying the entire series much more than I'd expected.

### Perfect 10s

There are some excellent movies that I really love on this list. I accept that horror movies will inevitably have plot holes, issues, illogical bits, but I might still rate them a 10. Scream, The Babadook, the original Friday the 13th - these are all just "perfect" horror movies to me.

### Ari Aster

I capped the month with Midsommar and Hereditary. These movies stand alone as such uniquely twisted bits of artistic film making. They are visceral, dark, and horrifying. Both of these movies are so uniquely structured, gorgeously shot, extravagantly brutal.

I have been waiting for Ari's follow-up to his one-two punch in 2018 and 2019.

His work is incredible!

This year we got [Beau is Afraid](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13521006/); a 3 hour horror comedy about an anxious man's experience following the death of his mother. Its plot on IMDb contains the word Kafkaesque. I'm excited and nervous to see it.

### Other Thoughts?

I have many, and perhaps when I come back to finish this post I'll share them- or not. I've run over 70 movies and that's a lot of thoughts to share.

I tend to jot down my thoughts on each viewing as well, and perhaps I'll add them to this post as well.

Or maybe not
