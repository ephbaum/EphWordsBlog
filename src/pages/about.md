I'm Eph Baum. I wrote a bit about myself [here](https://github.com/ephbaum/#why-eph-baum) if you're interested (and recently migrated that content to this very blog [here](/posts/2023/10/2023-10-09-why-eph-baum)). I'm a software engineer, curmudgeonly gaming addict, father, friend, and human trying their best.

I've worn a lot of hats and had many varied experiences. I've many interests and passions.

<p class="text-center">I'm neurodiverse.</p>

I have a strong desire to share with others.

We have common ground in that, at the very least, we're both hurtling through the black void on this rock, probably. Unless you're in space, or on another planet, or in some other plane of existence, or whatever.

This is the place where I'm going to post the Eph words that don't fit on my [dev blog](https://ephbaum.dev).

## Blog Theme

I'm using the [Astro Paper theme](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper) from the quite talented [Sat Naing](https://satnaing.dev/)

I've been toying with the idea of a theme in the style of a an FTP index where the posts are files in the tree, tags are folders, and you can get a rendered or unrendered version of the markdown.

I decided that, for the time being however, using a vanilla theme will be substantially faster & easier than creating that theme, and that modifying this theme shouldn't be all that difficult either.

## But what's this blog _actually_ about?

It's about my need to have a place to post things. I have hundreds of draft posts of all sorts that need a home and I'm not getting any younger.

I have a variety of stories I want to share and I'm hopeful there are folks out there with some interest in them. Perhaps you're one?

It's about sharing my extreme transparency, oversharing perhaps, but my desire to put myself out there.
