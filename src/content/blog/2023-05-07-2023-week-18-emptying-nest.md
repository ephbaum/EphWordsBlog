I tried to have ChatGPT (GPT-4) write up a Â post as an apology for not having done a real post today and it was terrible, Â but I probably should have given more to the prompt ðŸ˜…:

> Title: Apology for the Incomplete Entry - Life Â Happens

> Dear readers,

> I want to take a moment to apologize for the incomplete entry I posted earlier. As you all know, life can be a whirlwind at times, and this week has been no exception. With so much going on, I wasn't able to provide the detailed and thoughtful content that I strive for on this blog. I truly value your time and readership, and I'm sorry for any confusion or disappointment my recent post may have caused.

> This week has been incredibly hectic for our family. Our 21-year-old daughter, Momo, is moving out on Monday, which has been a bittersweet experience filled with packing, planning, and plenty of emotions. Additionally, my workload has been piling up, with a myriad of tasks and projects demanding my attention. As if that wasn't enough, we're also navigating the joys and challenges of raising our adorable new puppy, Ollie, who's full of energy and curiosity.

> In the midst of all this, I've been juggling side work, parenting responsibilities, and even a dental cleaning appointment. As you can imagine, this chaotic schedule has left me with little time to sit down and craft a well-thought-out blog entry for you all.

> Please rest assured that I will be updating the incomplete post as soon as possible. I'm committed to providing you with quality content, and I appreciate your patience as I navigate this busy period in my life.

> Thank you for your understanding and for your continued support. I'm grateful to have such an understanding and empathetic community of readers. Stay tuned for the updated post and more exciting content in the coming days.

> Wishing you all the best,

> \[Your Name\]

Personally I find it amazing Â the tone ChatGPT chose here, as if Iâ€™m addressing our Â throngs of fans who yearn for this content ðŸ˜‚

Regardless, it was Â a busy and eventful week and I just did not make space to complete post that would need some special consideration given its scope

I do intend to update this post ðŸ¤ž

I Â have nothing but the best intentions

and

a trauma informed world view
