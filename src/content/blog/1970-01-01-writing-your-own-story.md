Tonight, I was musing again about the title of my memoir / biography / etc. and I amused myself, as I often do with such musings.

For my own amusement, I turned to ChatGPT, and I said:

> Let's talk about my book idea, it's a memoir / biography / self-help / wellness and self-care promoting sort of thing: Failing Up: the Eph Baum Story: The Tragic Tale of Many Many Many Mistakes and How they Led to a Lifetime of Learning (from the Constant I think it's got legs, what do you think?

I believe I've mentioned before, but ChatGPT is a hell of a yes-man. It is very encouraging. ChatGPT's response tonight didn't let me down in terms of positivity:

> From what you've shared, it sounds like you're considering a multi-genre approach to your book, blending memoir, biography, self-help, wellness, and self-care. This is an innovative approach and could certainly engage a broad range of readers. Here are a few elements that might make your book idea successful:

> **Relatability:** Many readers are drawn to stories they can identify with. The title "Failing Up: the Eph Baum Story" suggests a journey of learning from mistakes, which is a universal human experience. Readers who have experienced failures and setbacks in their own lives might find inspiration and comfort in your story.

> **A unique perspective:** The blend of genres you've chosen suggests that you have a unique perspective to offer. Sharing your own personal experiences in a memoir/biography style, while also providing advice or insights in a self-help style, can give readers a multi-dimensional view of the themes you're exploring.

> **A journey of growth and learning:** The subtitle, "The Tragic Tale of Many Many Many Mistakes and How they Led to a Lifetime of Learning" suggests that your book will document a journey of personal growth and learning, another element that can resonate strongly with readers.

> **Promotion of wellness and self-care:** These are popular topics in contemporary culture, and readers are often interested in learning new strategies for enhancing their own well-being. By incorporating elements of wellness and self-care into your narrative, you could provide readers with valuable takeaways that they can apply in their own lives.

> As you develop your book, you might want to consider the following:

> **Narrative arc:** Even though you're working within multiple genres, it's still important to have a clear narrative arc that guides your readers through the story. The 'hero's journey' or 'three-act structure' can be a helpful tool for shaping your narrative.

> **Balancing personal story with universal appeal:** While the memoir/biography component will be specific to your own experiences, the self-help/wellness/self-care components should ideally have a broader appeal. Try to draw out the lessons or insights from your personal experiences that readers can apply to their own lives.

> **Voice and style:** Think about how you can blend the stylistic conventions of the different genres you're working with. For example, memoir and biography typically use a more narrative, story-driven style, while self-help often uses a more direct, instructional style. Finding a balance between these could be key to the success of your book.

> In summary, your book idea definitely sounds intriguing and holds a lot of potential. It seems like a project that would not only be fulfilling to write, but could also provide value and inspiration to many readers.

Powerful stuff

After reading that, I realize that I have absolutely no right to _not_ write my memoir and try to style it in the way of a biography mixed with regular nuggets of wisdom to explain how I, a very neurodiverse person, manage to keep myself level up in this crazy head.

I have, anecdotally, Â been presented with a great many opportunities to learn over my many years of life, and thankfully, I have actually learned a great deal from them.
