As I love horror movies & Halloween. Every October (aka Halloween Month) I "watch" a slew of horror movies.

Autumn is my favorite season and my favorite time of year. Halloween is my favorite holiday. Halloween month is my favorite month. You get it.

Watching a slew of spoopy movies has been a tradition for most of my life. Recording these lists on spreadsheets started many years ago with a good friend. I now have many years of spreadsheets collecting all the horror movies I watched each year. One year was just 100% Netflix and another year I watched mostly _old_ horror movies. This year hasn't had a theme, I've just sort of watched things.

I don't actually _watch_ all of them, in a lot of cases these are movies that I've already seen and I just turn them on, glancing at them occasionally and listening to them. It's comforting.

This year I've run a lot of movies in a quest for some normalcy.

## A Few Notes

### Scream Franchise in Reverse?

You may notice that I've watched the Scream movies in reverse. (I only have the first movie left to watch as of this writing)

You may wonder: why the hell would you do that?

That's a fantastic question and the answer is simply that I watched the most recent movie before deciding that I would watch the entire franchise again so I figured: why not do it in reverse?

It's actually been really interesting to experience them in reverse order, it hearing the call backs and then seeing them later has been kind of fun in a way I didn't expect.

Scream remains my favorite horror franchise.

### Original Friday the 13th

I made an effort to get through the original Paramount run of Friday the 13th Movies on Friday the 13 since it was the first Friday the 13th in October since 2006. I only managed to run through 5 and didn't really _watch_ much of those as it was a rather busy Friday for me.

Since I have "watched" 6 through 8 and they are just so terrible. üòÇ

Still a super fun franchise, though.

The first 2 remain the best.

Like Scream

### X & Pearl (and Infinity Pool)

I really enjoyed X and Pearl. Ti West is an excellent horror auteur. Inn Keepers remains pretty high on my list of favorite horrors.

I also watched Infinity Pool, which had more of a David Lynch vibe than I was expecting, but has officially given me my fill of Mia Goth. I don't need to see Mia Goth in any more movies for a while.

### Other Thoughts?

I have many, and perhaps when I come back to finish this post I'll share them.

I tend to jot down my thoughts on each viewing as well, and perhaps I'll add them to this post as well.

Or maybe not
