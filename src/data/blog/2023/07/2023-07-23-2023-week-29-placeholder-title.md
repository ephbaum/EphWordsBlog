description: Wherein I promise to write a post about our trip to Ocean Shores and our drive around OLYM through Forks resulting in us finally having fully circumnavigated the Olympic Peninsula but then never actually did, apparently. There's a cute picture of Ollie on the beach, though. I should totally get back to this.

To be clear, I _will_ write a post...

We just just returned from vacation and family just moved to town

It's been a busy Saturday y'all

Update:

For additional context it should be noted that we drove home today from Ocean Shores by way of Forks and around the Olympic Peninsula via 101 marking a milestone to have fully circumnavigated OLYM

The entire trip was around six and a half hours of the beauty of the PNW and it was wonderful

A fuller account is intended so keep an eye out here
