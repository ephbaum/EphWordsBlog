When they say Covid has a long recovery time, they are not kidding.

While I went back to work last Friday. I don’t believe that I started to feel normal until Wednesday, or maybe Thursday, of this week.

The biggest challenge for me has been focus. My toolbox seems ill equipped to handle Covid brain fog. I’ve found myself lost frequently while trying to focus on literally anything.

This has been extremely frustrating as I feel like I have taken a huge step backwards in my ability to get things done. My toolbox for focus not working as well after Covid brain fog had me worried about my future. Focus abilities. Thankfully by the end of this week I had begun to feel much more normal.

I was able to reach and surpass level 200 in Fortnite chapter 4 season 1. It’s the first time I’ve made it that far in a season. Since I’m usually not to dedicate enough time to the grind. Meanwhile, I am excited about the next season. I generally enjoy Fortnite a lot more than I want to. I feel like I’ve reached a plateau in my skills, though, I am old man dad potato shoots. Mikey can outbuild me and can generally outshoot me. Oz has also gotten much better at building and while I can still generally out-shoot them, their younger reactions, more time to practice, their better graphics card, etc. are all playing in their favor and they’re getting much better. It was always a matter of time 😅

Today we were meant to pick up Mikey from the airport in the morning but his flight was delayed. Alaska needed a part from Delta and Delta was unable to deliver so the delay turned into cancellation. We were able to quickly book a new flight on Sun Country, which is always a cheap option but because they’re  kind of awful. Thankfully it all worked out and, only a few hours later than expected, make made it!

Of   course that meant  drive around the  sound- I5  is exhausting

This week I hiked a little less than 5 miles at Ilahee Preserve. I’m a little dissatisfied in myself for not quite hitting a full five miles but I’m accepting the win as I was at least able to get out for the first time since were were in Arizona.

It was also my first hike post-COVID and I definitely felt it. So I’ll also take it as a win to have done even 4.5 miles given how tired I was feeling by the time I had even gotten 3 miles into my trek.

It’s also worth noting that I have only hiked Ilahee preserve a handful of times. It’s not a very big park to begin with, I don’t think it even has a total of 10 miles of trails. I haven’t developed a good 5 mile route throughout, either.

But given its proximity, I’m going to try to make it a common stop for my regular hikes. My chore hikes. The ones I need to do.

I enjoy the drive on Perry Ave. plenty, there are some nice curves and beautiful views- as well as on the Manette bridge. It’s a great experience from start to finish. I wound of reflecting heavily on that on my recent drive home from that Thursday hike.

Tonight is the cutover for Daylight Saving so tomorrow will feel different.

Tomorrow will also be a big day as we’re planning a trip to Seattle for some Ramen  🍜 and to support Tris and her art! 🎨🖌️🖼️❤️
