description: A confessional return to blogging after over a year of silence, exploring the tension between living life and documenting it, and the eternal question of what we want to leave behind.

## It's been over a year since my last post.

That's it. That's the sin.

To be fair, I've written plenty of drafts. But to my shame, I haven't actually published anything since April 2024 (aside from a recent piece on _Sleepaway Camp III_).

A lot has happened in the meantime:

- a dozen camping trips
- innumerable hikes and adventures
- new (and relearned) life lessons
- separation and a change in living situation
- my kids' ongoing journeys
- media consumed, media created
- and so much more

It's been a lot, is what I'm saying.

The result: piles of drafts, countless photos, videos, and recordings — but very little of it has made its way here (or anywhere else). Instead, I've been focused on living my life and staying present.

I also stepped back from social media. For over a year, I've kept my distance from the noise, vitriol, and chaos online. It hasn't been total disconnection — I still keep an eye on the world — but I've tried to maintain healthier boundaries. It's been good. I've leaned on my family and friends, and I've been seeking community in other spaces, trying to figure out where I fit.

Lately, I've been asking myself what I want to do next. What I want to be when I "grow up" — a funny question to wrestle with in your mid-40s, but maybe one worth asking at any age. Is blogging the move? Writing? Podcasting? Video essays? Watercolors? Origami?

Some of this is tied to thoughts about legacy, about mortality. _Memento mori._ I've written a lot of words, taken a lot of photos, recorded my voice in a lot of places. I've always felt compelled to create — not because I need an audience, but because I want to leave something behind. A marker that says: I was here.

So here I am again, back at this blog. Maybe this time I'll find a rhythm. Maybe this time I'll stick with it.

Or maybe this post will be followed by another long silence. Only time will tell.
