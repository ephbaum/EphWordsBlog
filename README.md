# Eph Words dot Com

Since officially changing my name to Eph, I have thought a lot about the humor behind have a letter for a first name

Eph Words 

Eph Around 

Eph This and Eph That

All of these have come to mind at various times

## A Blog of Sorts 

I've had a "dev" blog for a while now and have not had a _personal_ blog for a great many years. Mostly that's an artifacnt of not feeling as thought I'e had time to really create or maintain one, but also there's certainly an ongoing sense that no one would much care to read my words anyway.

For all of 2023 I have, however, been posting every Saturday to a blog I created for my wife and I called Eph and Lou. We're Eph & Lou. This was a commitment I had made to myself, that I would post something every Saturday for the entire year and I'm super proud to have actually stuck with it.

Alas, Lou and I will no longer be Eph and Lou.

While we'll have been married for 13 years as of November 7th, 2023, we're no longer together. 

There are a lot of reasons for this, they're complicated, it's not a bad thing even if it's not exactly how I wanted things to turn out. 

Now, however, I've decided to migrate those posts, which were largely just me talking to myself as Lou never actually contributed to the blog I set up for us. There are lots of reasons for this, they're complicated , it's not a bad thing even if it's not excatly how I wanted things to turn out.

## Now What?

Well, that's a remarkably handsome question.

I'm going to try to figure that out and when I do I might even update this README

For now, I've just completed my first pass at converting those posts to markdown files and I'm going to work on getting the other content from that blog moved to this one. 

I will continue to post on Saturdays. I'm still committed.

I also want to try to post some more of the many many many drafts built up over the years. I have generated a lot of Eph Words over the years and maybe this is the place where I will share them.

I might even try to get my old Blogger blogs consolidated here

Maybe 

Seems like a long shot, but maybe
