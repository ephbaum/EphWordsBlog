To be clear, I _will_ write a post...

We just just returned from vacation and family just moved to town

It's a busy Saturday y'all

Update:

For additional context it should be noted that we drove home  today from Ocean Shores by way of Forks and around the  Olympic Peninsula via 101 marking a  milestone to have fully circumnavigated OLYM

The entire trip was around six and a half hours of the beauty of the PNW  and it was wonderful

A fuller account is intended so keep an eye out here
