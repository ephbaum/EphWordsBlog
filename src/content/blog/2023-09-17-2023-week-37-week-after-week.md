It seems redundant to continue saying, week after week, that life is hard, challenging, or trying, as I so often do.

Sometimes it feels like I'm just living life on hard mode.

This week marked the 22nd anniversary of the Sept. 11th, 2001 attack, which always brings a lot of reflection. Memories of watching events unfold that day are seared into my memory. As a young, naÃ¯ve father of two, it was terrifying to watch and think about the world my kids would inherit.

I find it interesting that so many people who were young or not even alive then, despite having heard about it their entire lives, don't see its significance in the same way. It makes me feel old. I agree with the sentiment that the death of a few thousand Americans being used to justify occupying Afghanistan for two decades is pretty terrible. But, the memory of watching people fall from those towers live on television will never leave me. September 11th will always be somber for me. Kebause trauma.

On that somber note, on to the week as it unfolded:

## Sunday

Liz had a sleepover at a friend's house, leaving Lou and me home alone in the morning. We took a long walk around town covering more than 5 miles along Burwell, down to Harborside Park, and then over along Evergreen through the Olympic College campus. We made a couple of stops: first at Crazy for Confectionery for some delicious treats and then at Cups downtown for a couple of decaf espressos.

It was a lovely way to spend a morning with my partner.

In other news, Lou was encouraged to run for the board of the [Kitsap Community Food Co-op](https://kitsapfood.coop/). She spent much of Sunday preparing a presentation for her candidacy. She believes she was anxious and didn't perform well, but I'm sure she did fine. I'm immensely proud of her, especially knowing that public speaking causes her anxiety. It sounds like she was the only candidate for three open spots, so she's likely in. ðŸ˜…

This is an opportunity she's excited about. Her passion for food is incredible, and she's become very skilled at crafting delicious meals. Our shared love of breakfast foods led to early dates at restaurants like [Fat Nat's Eggs](http://www.fatnatseggs.com/), some of my favorite memories.

Our relationship with food has evolved over the years, and I believe she'll have much to offer the co-op board with her lived experience.

## Monday, September 11th, 2023

As mentioned, Monday was the 22nd anniversary of the fall of the Twin Towers in New York City.

Liz is asserting herself at school to get the education she desires. Due to the last-minute nature of her registration, she was assigned two electives: Outdoor Leadership and Digital Photography. She wanted to pursue musical education and successfully switched to Orchestra, albeit with some disappointment at dropping her other courses.

We're not thrilled about the contract with the local music store for her violin, but we're pleased she's happy, and that's what matters.

## Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday

The weather cooled down, then warmed back up. We had some dentist visits and my #ThursdayHike was almost 7 miles at Newberry. I experienced the serenity that comes from Hiking Meditation.

## Friday

Some situations are better kept private, particularly when they concern our children. Friday presented us with a challenge involving our youngest, Liz, that requires some additional discipline and reflection.

## Saturday

Lou flew to Washington D.C. for [SCAN](https://savethechildrenactionnetwork.org/) to lobby lawmakers about the Farm Bill, tied to [SNAP benefits](https://www.benefits.gov/benefit/361) and childhood hunger.

Liz and I spent the day hiking in Newberry and watching [Elemental](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15789038/). We started reading [The Annotated Hobbit](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/823754.The_Annotated_Hobbit).

Now, however, I'm tired, it's late, and although I'm not entirely sure this post is readable, I'm going to bed.
