# Have We Met?

<div class="my-8 rounded-lg border-2 border-accent/30 bg-muted/30 p-6 shadow-sm">

Hey there! 👋

Are you one of the many people I've met lately?

If so: thank you for thinking of me 🙏

Also: you can definitely reach out.

Have we not met yet? Hit me up anyway!

<a href="mailto:mail@ephbaum.me">mail@ephbaum.me</a>

Utilize the modernity and power of electronic mail!

Or, feel free to track me down on social media.

Fair warning: I've been pretty disconnected from social media for a while now, so I may not be super prompt at replying. Honestly, there's a good chance I'll simply ignore you there though unless you stand out as clearly not a bot.

## Inviting Connection Seems Sketch

I get it. In a world where trust is hard‑won, an open‑door invitation can seem risky.

I’ve spent the last few years deep in introvert mode, buried in work and family, practically forgetting how rewarding genuine human connection can be. Lately, though, I’ve been deliberately stepping back into the social arena—bars, meet‑ups, spontaneous coffee chats—and it’s been refreshing.

A decade‑plus, a thousand‑plus miles, and countless life changes have reshaped my perspective, but one thing stays constant: people are fascinating.

Sure, some folks are guarded (rightfully so—bad actors exist). It’s natural to wonder about motives. My only motive here is simple: I want to meet interesting people, hear their stories, and share a few of mine.

I’m still learning to balance my social battery, and I’ll probably embarrass myself a few times along the way. That’s part of the fun.

So, if you’re curious, have a story to tell, or just want to say “hey,” drop me a line. Mention this post and I’ll know it’s you.
