It's almost half-way through 2023 and I'm feeling reflective on the progress we've made so far this year across so many fronts and it feels, a bit, like moving all the pawns turn-after-turn across a chess board.

Because AI is so trendy, and because I wanted to get some feedback on my chess board analogy, I turned to Google Bard as I'd not yet given it a try. I wanted to share its response because I found it interesting (read: flattering):

> The statement "It's almost half way through 2023 and I'm feeling reflective on the progress we've made so far this year across so many fronts and it feels, a bit, like moving all the pawns turn-after-turn across a chess board" suggests that the speaker is feeling a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction with the progress they have made so far this year. However, they also seem to be aware that there is still a lot of work to be done, and that they need to continue to make strategic moves in order to achieve their goals.
>
> The analogy of moving pawns across a chess board is apt, as it suggests that the speaker is making small, incremental steps towards their goals. Pawns are the weakest pieces in chess, but they can be used to protect more valuable pieces and to control the board. In the same way, the speaker's small steps may not seem like much, but they are all part of a larger plan to achieve success.

>

To be honest, I think there's some reaching here on the part of Google Bard, but I think it largely got my intent.

## Progress

There has been a lot of progress across a lot of fronts but all of them have been incremental. It also feels agonizingly slow, arrayed across multiple fronts, and from the "big picture" it feels like everything is at a stand still.

It's hard when everything feels like it needs to be a priority, it's hard to know where to apply tactical pressure in service of reaching many goals all at once.

## Self-Care

It was a busy Saturday for us, and to be frank, I prioritized my self care over trying to write a blog post for today in service of my commitment to myself (and you, dear reader üòÖüôè)

We ran some errands this morning that had us shooting back and forth across Bremerton and it gave us the opportunity to explore a bit around Navy Yard City and Sherman Heights, for example. There are such interesting different and distinct areas of Bremerton.

Today, getting around this town was a bit harder than usual as they shut down the downtown area bounded by 11th, Warren, and Burwell for the annual Armed Forces Day Parade.

Due the aforementioned errands, we weren't able to attend, but I do hope a good time was had by all. üòÄ

After our errands, however, we grabbed some sushi for lunch and then made plans for some...

## Impromptu Family Togetherness Time

It was decided that it would probably be in all of our best interests to go to a park and enjoy the beautiful weather

A destination somewhere near Hood Canal we've visited was suggested, but I thought that maybe it was time for us to checkout [Kitsap Memorial State Park](https://www.parks.wa.gov/529/Kitsap-Memorial) and check it off the list.

The park is lovely! There was a wedding going on and it was packed with campers, which makes sense as it's called a camping park, it is definitely a well designed little park with just the right amount of space for day use and its playground seemed almost brand-new and fantastic. I really loved getting a chance to walk the rocky shore of the Hood Canal fjord with the Olympics just across the water

Spending time on a lovely Saturday afternoon was as potent a bit of self-care as I could have hoped!

It did, of course, set me back a bit on progress across all the fronts, but I'm sure somehow I'll "catch-up" ü§∑

It was worth it to catch it a little R&R with the family üòä

## Maybe I'll Circle Back

It's happened, I can say this for sure

For now, however, I'll leave this post here that this was another action packed week for the whole family that featured Lou getting out to connect more in the community, me making progress on several important ventures, and Ozz attended their last acting class of this term

Friday I took the ferry to Seattle to meet with some colleagues from my company for a bit of socialization and collaborations over a few pints at Locust Cider - it was a great experience and a gorgeous afternoon for it

There is plenty more that I could say about this week, but I won't because it's after 11pm and I need to get to bed

G'night World!
