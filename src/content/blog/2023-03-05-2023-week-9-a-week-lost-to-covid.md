After 3 years the inevitable has occurred: weâ€™ve had COVID tear through our home officially.

I think there was a small bout of COVID that Oz brought home from the playground or the rec center that I escaped, though at the time we didnâ€™t have rapid tests.

This tone, however, it started with me. My first symptoms appeared late Saturday and by Sunday I was down for the count. Monday I skipped work and rescheduled my chiropractic appointment for Friday after a negative test on Sunday. Monday, however, Lou tested positive and then I did the same.

Most of this week has been a blur of brain fog, body aches, and a stuffy-headed runny-nosed congestion.

Having a puppy while fighting COVID sucks.

This little guy has been a champ But this is nothing like how we expected new puppy time would go. I thought weâ€™d be healthy, as weâ€™d been, I thought weâ€™d be able to focus on training.

Instead we spent the vast majority of the the week resting and and recuperating.

Iâ€™m still feeling exhausted.

In other news, the final birthday of this season's Birthmasmageddon has come to pass with Tris turning 23 years old. I'm so proud of that kid: she's got her work up at Yoroshiku in Seattle ðŸ¤©([https://www.yoroshikuseattle.com](https://www.yoroshikuseattle.com))
