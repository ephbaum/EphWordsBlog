I want to believe.

I really do.

I have heard of Shrimpy a few times over the years. I remember reading [this story](https://www.kitsapsun.com/story/news/local/2019/06/20/giant-shrimp-laundry-room-tale-bremertons-own-cryptid/1513680001/) in the Kitsap Sun not very long before we moved here to beautiful (and strange) Bremerton, WA and feeling some mild excitement over the idea of a local cryptid.

Of course, I recognized immediately that this particular story is rather unlikely, but [I want so much to believe](https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/283229-i-want-to-believe).

There's some issues, however.

**First of all**, Shrimpy isn't even recognized on the [wikipedia cryptid page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cryptids).

It is, however, a few other places on the Internet:

- [liminal.earth](https://liminal.earth/2019/02/27/giant-shrimp-in-the-laundry-room-the-beast-from-bremerton/)
- [nexusnewsfeed.com](https://nexusnewsfeed.com/article/unexplained/giant-shrimp-in-the-laundry-room/)
- [oscurban-legend.fandom.com](https://obscurban-legend.fandom.com/wiki/Giant_Shrimp_in_the_Laundry_Room)
- [paranormal-strange.fandom.com](https://paranormal-strange.fandom.com/wiki/Bremerton_Giant_Shrimp)
- [cryptopia.us](https://www.cryptopia.us/site/2018/09/bremerton-monstrosity-washington-usa/)
- [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qkw90CK3M)
- [titleknown.tumblr.com](https://titleknown.tumblr.com/post/154879768233/hi-my-name-is-virginia-staples-and-in-1948-i)

They all cite the same "evidence" however.

**Second of all**, the only evidence of said creature is of a supposed recording that was trascribed in issue #6 of Strange Mag in 1990. The account is enshrined [here](http://www.strangemag.com/firstperson.html#giantshrimp).

And I do so now:

> Hi. My name is Virginia Staples and in 1948 I lived in Bremerton, Washington. The apartment where I lived had a gigantically huge basement. There were huge holes in the walls and the apartment house manager used to tell me that it was rumored there was a passage to the water. The huge apartment houses were so close together and they all had basements and they were old buildings. There was a washer and a washtub and a clothesline. And on this particular day I had gotten my clothes all hung up but I kept feeling someone was staring at me or looking at me. And it was such a creepy feeling I finally turned around and looked towards the back of the basement and froze. I was so scared I can still feel it. I couldn't move. In one of the huge holes in the basement there stood this thing.
> [She breaks down here.] Oh, it was horrible! I stand five foot tall and this creature was as tall as I was. It had a bright orange colored body and little spidery thin legs and antennae on its head that kept moving back and in and out.
> [Crying now.] That thing started towards me. I backed out of the basement and got up to my apartment and I packed all my things and moved. I was so scared. I moved over to Seattle to my cousin's. I went to an aquarium to see if I could see anything that looked like what it was, and the only thing that I could find that looked anything like it was this little tiny shrimp. But it just doesn't make sense. I had horrible nightmares for years. I finally got up enough nerve a couple of years ago to go back to revisit Bremerton. But the Navy has enlarged so much and the apartment house on Denny Street has been torn down. Really nobody would really believe this, but as God is my witness it really happened.

The recent [Underground Tunnels](https://www.bremelore.wtf/extras/underground-tunnels) episode of the ever wonderful [Bremelore Podcast](https://anchor.fm/bremelore) had me thinking about this account due to the supposed "gigantically huge basement" as that episode mentions that many of the buildings in downtown Bremerton have large shared basements due to having had shared furnaces. This had me looking back at this story but, that leads to another issue...

**Third of all**, [Denny Street](https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/5916521) is nowhere near [PSNS](https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/414855) in Bremerton. As you can see from these map links, NE Denny Street is actually in East Bremerton on the other side of the Port Washington Narrows nearer to Illahee than the shipyard. The above Kitsap Sun article calls this out:

> The story has its inconsistencies. County assessorsâ€™ records show Denny Street, a small side road between Perry Avenue and Trenton Avenue in East Bremerton, has several houses that date back to the early '30s and '40s and a few empty lots. But Staplesâ€™ said that her apartment house on Denny was torn down after the Navy expanded.

> Unless a different Denny Street was consumed as the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard expanded, it doesnâ€™t appear as if the Navy has a presence in that area. Any apartment on the road would be a significant distance away from the water, making it unlikely that a tunnel could run from the Puget Sound to a basement of a home there, as was rumored.

I suppose it's possible, and worth researching, that there was another Denny St. back in 1948. It's also possible that the caller had mixed up the name or they were referring instead to [Dewey Street](https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/5918946). To my understanding, though, the footprint of the shipyard has been relatively unchanged since Ms. Staples would have left, so I find this whole account highly dubious.

Still, it's a lot of fun to imagine a 5 foot tall orange shrimp in Bremerton, right?

Fun, too, was wasting a few computing cycles by having [DALL-E 3](https://openai.com/dall-e-3) generate some images of the story:

(Just to interject here, this is amazing, but I can assure you that this is not at all what modern day Bremerton looks like, espcially not the massive aircraft carrier with office buidling on its deck ðŸ¤£)

So, what do you think?

Do you believe there was a 5 foot tall orange shrimp wandering around Bremerton, WA basements post WWII?

Or is this just some silly bit of nonsense included in Strange Mag pre-Internet and they simply picked Bremerton and Denny Street somewhat at random to use as the backdrop of their first-person story?
