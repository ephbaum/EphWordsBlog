# Eph Words dot Com

Since officially changing my name to Eph, I've thought a lot about the humor behind having a letter for a first name and the ways I could "use it":

- Eph Words
- Eph Around
- Eph This/That

These, and many others, have to come mind over the years.

## A Blog of Sorts

I've had a ["dev" blog](https://ephbaum.dev) for quite a while now but have not had a _personal_ blog for a great many years. Mostly that's an artifact of not feeling as though I've had time to really create or maintain one, but also there's always the ever present sense that no one would much care to read my words anyway.

For all of 2023 I did, however, post every Saturday to a blog I created for my partner and I called Eph & Lou(dotcom). This was the result of a commitment I had made to myself that I would post something every Saturday for the entire year and I'm super proud to have actually stuck with it. The reasons can be found in the archive of this site.

Alas, Lou and I took a break from being Eph & Lou for a while.

As of November 7th, 2023, we've been married for 13 years and as of the last commit of this file we're still working on being together. And, appropriately, we're also working on being apart. It's been a hell of a journey for us and our little family.

Given our break and various changes to the dynamics of our relationship coupled with the fact that _our_ blog had really just turned out to be "my blog", I've decided to migrate those posts, which were largely just me talking to myself anyway as Lou ultimately never personally contributed to that blog.

## Now What?

Well, that's a remarkably handsome question (I've just asked myself, but suspect you, dear reader, should you exist, might ask yourself).

I'm going to try to figure that out and when I do I might even update this README (Spoiler: not yet).

For now, I've just completed a couple passes at converting those posts to markdown files and I'm going to work on getting the other content from that blog (and eventually some others, perhaps) moved to this one.

~I will continue to post on Saturdays. I'm still committed.~ (And I did, but that 1-year commitment has ended ðŸ˜…)

I also want to try to post some more of the many many many drafts have built up over the years. I have generated a lot of "Eph Words" over the years and maybe this is the place where I will share them.

I might even try to get my old Blogger blogs consolidated here

Maybe

Seems like a long shot, but maybe
