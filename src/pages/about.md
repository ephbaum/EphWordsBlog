I'm Eph Baum. I write a bit about my name [here](https://github.com/ephbaum/#why-eph-baum) if you're interested. I'm a software engineer, curmudgeonly gaming verteran, father, husband, and human trying their best. We have common ground in that, at the very least, we're both hurtling through space on this rock, probably. Unless you're in space, or on another planet, or whatever. 

This is the place where I'm going to post the eph words that don't fit on my [dev blog](https://ephbaum.dev)

## Blog Theme

I'm using the [Astro Paper theme](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper) from the quite talented [Sat Naing](https://satnaing.dev/)

I've been toying with the idea of a theme in the style of a an FTP index where the posts are files in the tree, tags are folders, and you can get a rendered or unrendered version of the markdown.

I decided that, for the time being however, using a vanilla theme will be substantially faster, and easier, than desinging that theme, and that modifying this theme shouldn't be all that difficult either. 

## But what's this about?

It's about my need to have a place to post things. I have hundreds of draft posts of all sorts that need a home and I'm not getting any younger. 

It's about sharing my extreme transparency, oversharing perhaps, but my desire to put myself out there.
